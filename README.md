# WiFi Compass
WiFi Compass helps to find the location of indoor Access Points by analyzing the WiFi Received Signal Strengh Indication of different measurig points in the building. A built-in Step Detection Algorithm that uses the accelerometer tracks the user movement in a building. Measuring point positions can also be set manually.

WiFi Compass was developed by Paul Woelfel and Thomas Konrad as a part of their [master thesis at University of Applied Sciences St. Poelten, Austria, which could be downloaded here](http://goo.gl/oeCpbG). It is published as Open Source software Google Code.
