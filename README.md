# Smartshop

Smartshop is a prototype indoor positioning system that aims to help visually impaired users to locate items within a grocery store. The colour scheme of the application is designed to be accessible for all users, there is also a voice output that directs users to their selected items. 

This application is based on the [url=https://github.com/r00tat/wificompass]WiFi Compass[/url] app by Paul Woelfel and Thomas Konrad.
