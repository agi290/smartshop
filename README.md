Smartshop

Smartshop is a prototype indoor positioning system that aims to help visually impaired users to locate items within a grocery store. It attempts to track the user's location by calculating the approximate position of the building's access points using WiFi trilateration while using a step detection algorithm to track the user's movements. The colour scheme of the application is designed to be accessible for all users, there is also a voice output that directs users to their selected items. 
 
 This application is based on the [WiFi Compass](https://github.com/r00tat/wificompass) app by Paul Woelfel and Thomas Konrad.
